            <div class="txtr col"><div class="pane">Several urushi techniques have been used in combination on this piece. As the many lacquer layers were built up, varieties of gold powder were sprinkled on wet lacquer. The underlying relief designs were worked in various lacquer and powder pastes. This was the most ornate type of shelved cabinet traditionally owned by Japanese noble families, and containing numerous small matching boxes.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>

W.40-1977</em></p></div></div></div>
            <div class="txtr col"><div class="pane">Eileen Gray learned the highly specialised craft of lacquer in Paris, under a Japanese master, Seizo Sugawara. On this folding screen, a Japanese furniture form, she applied lacquer using standard methods but omitted the traditional, varied and complex decorative techniques.  The resulting aesthetic was very un-Japanese with geometric panels of coarse stucco boldly contrast with flat, mirror-like surfaces.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>

            <div class="txtr col"><div class="pane">The back and seat boards are lacquered, and were made in China. They were exported to Britain – flat-packed – and assembled on an English frame, japanned black to match. Chinese craftsmen were adept at supplying lacquer for export, following designs provided by Western merchants. However, the requirements of low price and fast turnaround led to a reduction in quality.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>

            <div class="txtr col"><div class="pane">Shortages in the supply of lacquer to Europe encouraged the dismantling of older, imported furniture such as cabinets. To create this Parisian commode, five sections of urushi lacquered wood were reused. Great skill was required to avoid damaging the lacquer when sawing the double-sided panels, reducing their thickness, and heat-bending them to the curvilinear carcase. Metal mounts conceal the joins.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>

            <div class="txtr col"><div class="pane">European japanners experimented with numerous techniques and ingredients. On this bureau a coloured alcohol varnish made with plant resin was used. It was relatively quick-drying but the results were delicate. For smoothness, gesso was layered on close-grained wood veneer. Workshops were well-heated for the laborious process of applying, drying and polishing coats of varnish.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>

Inspiration probably included East Asian lacquer rarities as well as Indo-Portuguese and Islamic wares similarly exotic in appearance, but decorated using shellac. This cabinet is painted and gilded on a white gesso ground, not ‘japanned’ with multiple coats of varnish, individually polished. A plant resin varnish added lustre and protected the surface.</p></div><div class="ctrl"><span>A</span><span class="lfont">A</span></div></div></div>
